# Network Incident Report â€“ DDoS Attack Response

## Objective  
This project involved analyzing and responding to a DDoS attack on a fictional multimedia company using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The goal was to produce a clear incident report and outline an improvement plan for future incident prevention and response.

### Skills Learned  
- Understanding and applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- Incident response planning and documentation  
- Identifying vulnerabilities in firewall configurations  
- Developing network protection strategies  
- Enhancing detection and recovery processes  

### Tools Used  
- Network monitoring tools  
- IDS/IPS systems  
- Firewall configuration management  
- Google Docs (for documentation/report writing)

## Steps  
#### These steps include screenshots taken from the Incident Response Template utilized during the process.

### 1. Summary of the Incident 
- The company experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using ICMP packets, disrupting internal services for 2 hours.  
- The attack exposed an unconfigured firewall, allowing malicious traffic into the network.

### 2. Identify (NIST CSF)
- Weakness discovered: Firewall lacked ICMP filtering and rate limiting.  
- Regular network audits recommended to find similar gaps.  
- Access control and firewall configuration needed review.

### 3. Protect
- A new firewall rule was created to limit incoming ICMP packets.  
- Source IP address verification was implemented to detect spoofed traffic.  
- Staff were reminded of incident handling protocols.

### 4. Detect 
- Network monitoring tools were introduced to track traffic anomalies.  
- An IDS/IPS was deployed to detect and flag suspicious ICMP traffic.  
- Alerts were configured to notify the team in case of future traffic spikes.

### 5. Respond
- ICMP packets were blocked immediately during the attack.  
- Non-essential network services were disabled temporarily.  
- The attack was contained and logged for analysis.

### 6. Recover
- Critical services were restored after traffic normalized.  
- The team conducted a post-incident review.  
- Recovery procedures were documented and tested.

## Conclusion  
This incident report demonstrates the importance of a proactive cybersecurity approach using the NIST CSF. The organization effectively mitigated a real-time threat and implemented long-term security improvements, including firewall reconfiguration, monitoring tools, and response protocols. Applying this framework helps strengthen resilience and ensures the organization is better prepared for future threats.
